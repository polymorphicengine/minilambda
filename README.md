# minilambda

An experimental investigation into extending the Tidal Mini-Notation to a Lambda-Calculus style programming language

MiniLambda code is compiled into Haskell code which is then evaluated interactively via Hint and results in a Tidal Pattern.

We therefore have lazy evaluation and full pattern-matching within MiniLambda.
